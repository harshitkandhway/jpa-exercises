    We can convert the image in byte[]  before storing it in database.
    try {
            File file = new File("C:/dev/image/mario.jpg");
            byte[] picInBytes = new byte[(int) file.length()];
            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
            fileInputStream.read(picInBytes);
            fileInputStream.close();
            employee.setPicture(picInBytes);
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
     After running the DbApp the object gets persisted in database with a column named pic and the image gets
     stored in BLOB.
