Solution
1) In EmployeeWithFieldAccess when we give @Id annotation at field the default is FieldAccess so there
is no need to specify the AccessType.FieldType.

2) In EmployeeWithMixedAccess we can give the @Id annotation at field as the AccessType.FieldType is at
Entity level and the AccessType.PropertyType is at method getEmailAddress so it will create a new column named email_address in DB.

3) In EmployeeWithPropertyAccess we can only give the @Id annotation at field as the AccessType.PropertyType
is at Entity level.
